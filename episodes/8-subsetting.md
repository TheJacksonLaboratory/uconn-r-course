------------------------------------------------------------------------

R has many powerful subset operators. Mastering them will allow you to easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset.

There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

Let's start with the workhorse of R: a simple numeric vector.

``` r
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
```

    ##   a   b   c   d   e 
    ## 5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5

> Atomic vectors
> --------------
>
> In R, simple vectors containing character strings, numbers, or logical values are called *atomic* vectors because they can't be further simplified. {: .callout}

So now that we've created a dummy vector to play with, how do we get at its contents?

Accessing elements using their indices
--------------------------------------

To extract elements of a vector we can give their corresponding index, starting from one:

``` r
x[1]
```

    ##   a 
    ## 5.4

``` r
x[4]
```

    ##   d 
    ## 4.8

It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. For vectors (and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

We can ask for multiple elements at once:

``` r
x[c(1, 3)]
```

    ##   a   c 
    ## 5.4 7.1

Or slices of the vector:

``` r
x[1:4]
```

    ##   a   b   c   d 
    ## 5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8

the `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right.

``` r
1:4
```

    ## [1] 1 2 3 4

``` r
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

    ## [1] 1 2 3 4

We can ask for the same element multiple times:

``` r
x[c(1,1,3)]
```

    ##   a   a   c 
    ## 5.4 5.4 7.1

If we ask for an index beyond the length of the vector, R will return a missing value:

``` r
x[6]
```

    ## <NA> 
    ##   NA

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:

``` r
x[0]
```

    ## named numeric(0)

> Vector numbering in R starts at 1
> ---------------------------------
>
> In many programming languages (C and Python, for example), the first element of a vector has an index of 0. In R, the first element is 1. {: .callout}

Skipping and removing elements
------------------------------

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return every element *except* for the one specified:

``` r
x[-2]
```

    ##   a   c   d   e 
    ## 5.4 7.1 4.8 7.5

We can skip multiple elements:

``` r
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
```

    ##   b   c   d 
    ## 6.2 7.1 4.8

> Tip: Order of operations
> ------------------------
>
> A common trip up for novices occurs when trying to skip slices of a vector. It's natural to try to negate a sequence like so:
>
> ``` r
> x[-1:3]
> ```
>
> This gives a somewhat cryptic error:
>
>     ## Error in x[-1:3]: only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
>
> But remember the order of operations. `:` is really a function. It takes its first argument as -1, and its second as 3, so generates the sequence of numbers: `c(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3)`.
>
> The correct solution is to wrap that function call in brackets, so that the `-` operator applies to the result:
>
> ``` r
> x[-(1:3)]
> ```
>
>     ##   d   e 
>     ## 4.8 7.5
>
> {: .callout}

To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the result back into the variable:

``` r
x <- x[-4]
x
```

    ##   a   b   c   e 
    ## 5.4 6.2 7.1 7.5

Subsetting by name
------------------

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of extracting by index:

``` r
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we can name a vector 'on the fly'
x[c("a", "c")]
```

    ##   a   c 
    ## 5.4 7.1

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the position of various elements can often change when chaining together subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

Subsetting through other logical operations
-------------------------------------------

We can also use any logical vector to subset:

``` r
x[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

    ##   c   e 
    ## 7.1 7.5

Since comparison operators (e.g. `>`, `<`, `==`) evaluate to logical vectors, we can also use them to succinctly subset vectors: the following statement gives the same result as the previous one.

``` r
x[x > 7]
```

    ##   c   e 
    ## 7.1 7.5

Breaking it down, this statement first evaluates `x>7`, generating a logical vector `c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`, and then selects the elements of `x` corresponding to the `TRUE` values.

We can use `==` to mimic the previous method of indexing by name (remember you have to use `==` rather than `=` for comparisons):

``` r
x[names(x) == "a"]
```

    ##   a 
    ## 5.4

> Tip: Combining logical conditions
> ---------------------------------
>
> We often want to combine multiple logical criteria. For example, we might want to find all the countries that are located in Asia **or** Europe **and** have life expectancies within a certain range. Several operations for combining logical vectors exist in R:
>
> -   `&`, the "logical AND" operator: returns `TRUE` if both the left and right are `TRUE`.
> -   `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right (or both) are `TRUE`.
>
> You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. These two-character operators only look at the first element of each vector and ignore the remaining elements. In general you should not use the two-character operators in data analysis; save them for programming, i.e. deciding whether to execute a statement.
>
> -   `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(eg `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).
>
> Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the `all` function (which returns `TRUE` if every element of the vector is `TRUE`) and the `any` function (which returns `TRUE` if one or more elements of the vector are `TRUE`). {: .callout}

> Tip: Non-unique names
> ---------------------
>
> You should be aware that it is possible for multiple elements in a vector to have the same name. (For a data frame, columns can have the same name --- although R tries to avoid this --- but row names must be unique.) Consider these examples:

Skipping named elements
-----------------------

Skipping or removing named elements is a little harder. If we try to skip one named element by negating the string, R complains (slightly obscurely) that it doesn't know how to take the negative of a string:

``` r
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we start again by naming a vector 'on the fly'
x[-"a"]
```

However, we can use the `!=` (not-equals) operator to construct a logical vector that will do what we want:

``` r
x[names(x) != "a"]
```

    ## named integer(0)

Skipping multiple named indices is a little bit harder still. Suppose we want to drop the `"a"` and `"c"` elements, so we try this:

``` r
x[names(x)!=c("a","c")]
```

    ## Warning in names(x) != c("a", "c"): longer object length is not a multiple
    ## of shorter object length

    ## a 
    ## 2

R did *something*, but it gave us a warning that we ought to pay attention to - and it apparently *gave us the wrong answer* (the `"c"` element is still included in the vector)!

So what does `!=` actually do in this case? That's an excellent question.

### Recycling

Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:

``` r
names(x) != c("a", "c")
```

    ## Warning in names(x) != c("a", "c"): longer object length is not a multiple
    ## of shorter object length

    ## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE

Why does R give `TRUE` as the third element of this vector, when `names(x)[3] != "c"` is obviously false? When you use `!=`, R tries to compare each element of the left argument with the corresponding element of its right argument. What happens when you compare vectors of different lengths?

![Inequality testing](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.1.png)

When one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:

![Inequality testing: results of recycling](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.2.png)

In this case R **repeats** `c("a", "c")` as many times as necessary to match `names(x)`, i.e. we get `c("a","c","a","c","a")`. Since the recycled `"a"` doesn't match the third element of `names(x)`, the value of `!=` is `TRUE`. Because in this case the longer vector length (5) isn't a multiple of the shorter vector length (2), R printed a warning message. If we had been unlucky and `names(x)` had contained six elements, R would *silently* have done the wrong thing (i.e., not what we intended it to do). This recycling rule can can introduce hard-to-find and subtle bugs!

The way to get R to do what we really want (match *each* element of the left argument with *all* of the elements of the right argument) it to use the `%in%` operator. The `%in%` operator goes through each element of its left argument, in this case the names of `x`, and asks, "Does this element occur in the second argument?". Here, since we want to *exclude* values, we also need a `!` operator to change "in" to "not in":

``` r
x[! names(x) %in% c("a","c") ]
```

    ## named integer(0)

Handling special values
-----------------------

At some point you will encounter functions in R that cannot handle missing, infinite, or undefined data.

There are a number of special functions you can use to filter out this data:

-   `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame containing `NA` (or `NaN`)
-   likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
-   `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
-   `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

Factor subsetting
-----------------

Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how do we subset the other data structures?

Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.

``` r
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
```

    ## [1] a a
    ## Levels: a b c d

``` r
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
```

    ## [1] b c c
    ## Levels: a b c d

``` r
f[1:3]
```

    ## [1] a a b
    ## Levels: a b c d

Skipping elements will not remove the level even if no more of that category exists in the factor:

``` r
f[-3]
```

    ## [1] a a c c d
    ## Levels: a b c d

Matrix subsetting
-----------------

Matrices are also subsetted using the `[` function. In this case it takes two arguments: the first applying to the rows, the second to its columns:

``` r
set.seed(1)
m <- matrix(rnorm(6*4), ncol=4, nrow=6)
m[3:4, c(3,1)]
```

    ##             [,1]       [,2]
    ## [1,]  1.12493092 -0.8356286
    ## [2,] -0.04493361  1.5952808

You can leave the first or second arguments blank to retrieve all the rows or columns respectively:

``` r
m[, c(3,4)]
```

    ##             [,1]        [,2]
    ## [1,] -0.62124058  0.82122120
    ## [2,] -2.21469989  0.59390132
    ## [3,]  1.12493092  0.91897737
    ## [4,] -0.04493361  0.78213630
    ## [5,] -0.01619026  0.07456498
    ## [6,]  0.94383621 -1.98935170

If we only access one row or column, R will automatically convert the result to a vector:

``` r
m[3,]
```

    ## [1] -0.8356286  0.5757814  1.1249309  0.9189774

If you want to keep the output as a matrix, you need to specify a *third* argument; `drop = FALSE`:

``` r
m[3, , drop=FALSE]
```

    ##            [,1]      [,2]     [,3]      [,4]
    ## [1,] -0.8356286 0.5757814 1.124931 0.9189774

Unlike vectors, if we try to access a row or column outside of the matrix, R will throw an error:

``` r
m[, c(3,6)]
```

    ## Error in m[, c(3, 6)]: subscript out of bounds

> Tip: Higher dimensional arrays
> ------------------------------
>
> when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, each argument to `[` corresponds to a dimension. For example, a 3D array, the first three arguments correspond to the rows, columns, and depth dimension.
>
> {: .callout}

Because matrices are vectors, we can also subset using only one argument:

``` r
m[5]
```

    ## [1] 0.3295078

This usually isn't useful, and often confusing to read. However it is useful to note that matrices are laid out in *column-major format* by default. That is the elements of the vector are arranged column-wise:

``` r
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
```

    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
    ## [1,]    1    3    5
    ## [2,]    2    4    6

If you wish to populate the matrix by row, use `byrow=TRUE`:

``` r
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
```

    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
    ## [1,]    1    2    3
    ## [2,]    4    5    6

Matrices can also be subsetted using their rownames and column names instead of their row and column indices.

List subsetting
---------------

Now we'll introduce some new subsetting operators. There are three functions used to subset lists. We've already seen these when learning about atomic vectors and matrices: `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

Using `[` will always return a list. If you want to *subset* a list, but not *extract* an element, then you will likely use `[`.

``` r
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist[1]
```

    ## $a
    ## [1] "Software Carpentry"

This returns a *list with one element*.

We can subset elements of a list exactly the same way as atomic vectors using `[`. Comparison operations however won't work as they're not recursive, they will try to condition on the data structures in each element of the list, not the individual elements within those data structures.

``` r
xlist[1:2]
```

    ## $a
    ## [1] "Software Carpentry"
    ## 
    ## $b
    ##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

To extract individual elements of a list, you need to use the double-square bracket function: `[[`.

``` r
xlist[[1]]
```

    ## [1] "Software Carpentry"

Notice that now the result is a vector, not a list.

You can't extract more than one element at once:

``` r
xlist[[1:2]]
```

    ## Error in xlist[[1:2]]: subscript out of bounds

Nor use it to skip elements:

``` r
xlist[[-1]]
```

    ## Error in xlist[[-1]]: attempt to select more than one element in get1index <real>

But you can use names to both subset and extract elements:

``` r
xlist[["a"]]
```

    ## [1] "Software Carpentry"

The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:

``` r
xlist$data
```

    ##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
    ## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
    ## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa

Data frames
-----------

Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules apply. However they are also two dimensional objects:

`[` with one argument will act the same way as for lists, where each list element corresponds to a column. The resulting object will be a data frame:

``` r
surveys <- read.csv(file="surveys.csv")
head(surveys[3])
```

    ##   day
    ## 1  16
    ## 2  16
    ## 3  16
    ## 4  16
    ## 5  16
    ## 6  16

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:

``` r
head(surveys[["lifeExp"]])
```

    ## NULL

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:

``` r
head(surveys$year)
```

    ## [1] 1977 1977 1977 1977 1977 1977

With two arguments, `[` behaves the same way as for matrices:

``` r
surveys[1:3,]

    ##   record_id month day year plot_id species_id sex hindfoot_length weight
    ## 1         1     7  16 1977       2         NL   M              32     NA
    ## 2         2     7  16 1977       3         NL   M              33     NA

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because the elements are mixed types):

``` r
surveys[3,]
```

    ##   record_id month day year plot_id species_id sex hindfoot_length weight
    ## 3         3     7  16 1977       2         DM   F              37     NA

But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).
